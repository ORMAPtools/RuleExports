# RuleExports

9/28/2022

These attribute rules are written as part of the ORMAP Parcel Fabric project.
They were tested at ArcGIS Pro 2.9.4. (They might work on older versions but
have not been tested.)


## Where to get these files

Download the current version in a zip file from 
https://ormaptools.github.io

These rule files are included there in T7-4.zip and separately in RuleExports.zip

The source code is kept in Github version control at 
https://github.com/ORMAPTools/RuleExports


## How to load the rules into ArcGIS Pro

Each tool is exported to a separate .CSV file.


## List Of Attribute Rules

I will briefly describe each of them here soon.

* Anno0100Scale, Anno0200Scale, Anno0400Scale, Anno2000Scale
* CartographicLines
* ConstructionLines
